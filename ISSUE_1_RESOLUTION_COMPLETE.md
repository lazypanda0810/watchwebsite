## 🔧 **CRITICAL FIX - Auto Admin Creation**

### **Problem Identified:**
Even with all admin features implemented, there was no way to access them initially because no admin user existed.

### **Solution Implemented:**
```javascript
// backend/src/index.js
const initializeApp = async () => {
  try {
    await connectDB();
    console.log('🔧 Initializing application...');
    
    // Create default admin user if it doesn't exist
    await createDefaultAdmin();
    console.log('✅ Application initialization complete');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('❌ Application initialization failed:', error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
};
```

### **Default Admin Credentials:**
- **Email**: `admin@premiumwatches.com`
- **Password**: `SecureAdminPassword123!`
- **Role**: `admin` (full access)
- **Status**: Active and verified
